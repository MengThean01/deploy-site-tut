    <h1>Read me?</h1>
    <p>The world was holding its breath.
        It was July 20, 1969 — and the air in Mission Control was thick with tension. Every engineer, scientist, and pilot in that room had spent years preparing for this moment, but now it all came down to one thing: a fragile lander, hurtling toward a gray, distant world.
        The Descent
        Inside the Eagle, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were calm, but their heart rates told another story.
        “Fuel reading low,” Buzz said, glancing at the display. They had less than a minute’s worth left.
        Neil didn’t answer at first. He was too focused — scanning the uneven lunar surface. The computer had guided them toward a crater filled with boulders. If he followed the programmed path, the lander might tip and destroy itself.
        So, he took control.
        The lander hovered, dust spraying in all directions. The clock was ticking — 60 seconds… 30… 20…
        Then came his voice, quiet but steady:
        “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.”
        In Houston, people jumped from their chairs, hugging, shouting, crying. All around the world, millions watching black-and-white screens erupted in joy. Humanity had done something no one thought possible — we had landed on another world.
        The First Step
        Hours later, the hatch opened.
        Neil Armstrong stepped down the ladder slowly, his boot touching the powdery surface. The fine lunar dust floated like smoke before settling back down — untouched for billions of years until now.
        “One small step for man… one giant leap for mankind.”
        On Earth, there was silence. In homes, schools, and crowded squares, people simply stared — some in disbelief, others in tears. They weren’t just seeing a man on the Moon; they were seeing what humanity could be when united by wonder instead of fear.
        Buzz Aldrin followed, his voice full of awe. “Beautiful view. Magnificent desolation.”
        They planted the American flag, but this was no act of conquest. On the flag’s pole was a plaque that read:
        Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D.
        We came in peace for all mankind.
        Moments of Silence
        For two and a half hours, they walked, worked, collected rocks, and ran experiments. Every movement was careful — gravity made them bounce like children, but one wrong step could mean disaster. Above them, Earth shone bright and blue — a fragile marble hanging in the blackness.
        Neil paused once, looking at it.
        From here, there were no borders, no wars, no divisions. Just one home.
        The Return
        Back inside Eagle, as they prepared to lift off, the dust had already begun to settle. Their footprints would remain for thousands, maybe millions, of years — silent evidence that humanity had once stood there.
        When they rejoined Columbia, Michael Collins welcomed them with a smile. He hadn’t touched the surface, but he had been the link — the one who waited in solitude, orbiting the Moon, ensuring they could all return.
        And when Apollo 11 finally splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, the recovery crew greeted them not as soldiers, not as Americans, but as explorers of Earth.</p>
